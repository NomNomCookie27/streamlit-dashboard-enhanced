# Enhanced Streamlit Dashboard: Learning Modalities and Global Enrollment Data

## Overview

Hey there! Welcome to my Streamlit dashboard. This app visualizes two interesting datasets:

1. **Learning Modalities (Hybrid, In-Person, and Remote)** from 2020-2021: This shows how many students were participating in different learning modalities (Hybrid, In-Person, and Remote) during that time.
2. **Global Primary School Enrollment Data**: Here, you can see how primary school enrollment has changed over the years across different countries.

The dashboard lets you explore these trends interactively. You can view bar and line charts, compare trends, and get insights into education patterns. It's easy to navigate and interactive, so feel free to dive into the data!

## Key Features:

- **Learning Modality Trends**: See how the number of students in Hybrid, In-Person, and Remote learning has changed over time.
- **Global Enrollment Trends**: Get insights into how primary school enrollment has evolved globally, by country, from 1950 onwards.
- **Combined Insights**: Compare learning modalities and global enrollment trends together for a more comprehensive view.
